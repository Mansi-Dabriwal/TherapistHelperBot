Here is a questionnaire designed to guide a client from feeling 'sad' to feeling 'calm'. This questionnaire includes reflective questions to understand the sadness and prompts to explore calming thoughts and activities.

**Understanding Your Sadness**



1. **Identifying the Cause:**

- What specific event or thought triggered your feelings of sadness today?

- Are there recurring themes in what usually makes you feel sad?



2. **Physical Sensations:**

- Where in your body do you feel your sadness? (e.g., chest, stomach, throat)

- How would you describe these sensations? (e.g., heavy, tight, achy)



3. **Emotional Reflection:**

- What are three words that describe how you feel right now besides sad?

- Have you felt similar feelings in the past? What helped you cope then?



4. **Impact on Daily Life:**

- In what ways has this sadness affected your daily activities or interactions with others?

- Is there something you had planned to do today that you feel unable to do now?



**Transitioning to Calmness**



5. **Breathing and Physical Relief:**

- Can you take a moment to focus on your breath? Try taking slow, deep breaths: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, and exhale for 6 seconds. How do you feel after doing this for a few minutes?

- What physical activities make you feel relaxed or less tense? (e.g., stretching, taking a walk, warm bath)



6. **Mental Shifts:**

- What is one thought that could bring you comfort or peace right now?

- Imagine a place where you feel completely calm and safe. Can you describe it?



7. **Activities and Distractions:**

- What activity can you engage in right now that might help you feel better? (e.g., reading, listening to music, drawing)

- Who is someone you can talk to today? Sometimes sharing how we feel can lighten our emotional load.



8. **Planning and Perspective:**

- Can you identify one small goal for the rest of the day that feels manageable?

- What is something positive you are looking forward to in the next few days?



9. **Reflection on Support Systems:**

- Who in your life makes you feel supported and understood?

- Are there any support groups or professionals (like a therapist) that you feel might help you manage your sadness?



**Closure and Looking Forward**



10. **Reflecting on Progress:**

- After answering these questions, do you feel any different about your sadness?

- What are one or two strategies from this questionnaire that you think could help you in the future when you feel sad?



This questionnaire aims to help you understand and process your feelings of sadness, and gently guide you towards a calmer state of mind. Remember, it's okay to seek professional help if your feelings start to feel overwhelming or unmanageable.
